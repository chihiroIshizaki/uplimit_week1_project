The momentum of a moving object can be calculated by multiplying the mass of the object by its velocity. Momentum is a vector quantity and it is given in kilogram meters per second. The law of conservation of momentum states that the momentum of an isolated system remains unchanged. This means that the momentum before a collision or explosion is equal to the momentum after it. This is a direct consequence of Newton's third law. In a collision, the force that an object exerts on the other is equal to the force that the second object exerts on the first. Since these forces are exerted for the same amount of time, the momentum lost by one object is gained by the other, and thus momentum is conserved. Okay, so let's have a look at a question from this topic. Explain how the law of conservation of momentum relates to Newton's third law. If you aren't sure about how to solve this problem, you can visit the page of this topic, which is in the show notes. Did you know that we have other podcasts for math and science? If you are interested to learn more, search for Revision with Jonas on Apple Podcasts or Spotify. So let's learn more about momentum and force. The change in momentum in a system can be related to the force in the system by the following formula. Force is equal to change in momentum divided by time. This formula is derived by substituting the acceleration formula into Newton's second law. Okay, so let's have a look at a question from this topic. A book of mass 800 grams is pushed off a shelf with a force of 20 Newtons. Given that the book falls with an initial velocity of 2 meters per second, calculate the time of contact between the book and the hand pushing it. If you aren't sure about how to solve this problem, you can visit the page of this topic, which is in the show notes. Some students may struggle with exams because they might not get enough support at the right time. If you want to book our one pound trial lesson, go to studiesquare.co.uk forward slash trial while the offer is still available. During this session, we might determine some of your weaknesses and we may create an exam revision plan for the subject. Terms and conditions apply. Okay, so let's have a look at force-time graphs. Change in momentum is also known as impulse. Impulse can be calculated by multiplying the force exerted by the time over which it is exerted. Impulse is given by the area under a force-time graph for a system. If the area is made up of regular shapes, there's some mistake in calculating impulse. If the force-time graph is not a straight line, then the area under the graph can be approximated by counting squares. The question that relates to this theory is, define impulse. There's a link in the show notes of this episode in case you want to double check the answer for this question. I hope you have a great week ahead and until next time."}, "podcast_summary": "Hello there, young physics enthusiast! I'm here to help you boost your understanding and make your learning journey a joyful one. Let's dive into the concept of momentum and get you ready for those exams.\n\nMomentum is all about how much \"oomph\" an object has when it's moving. Imagine a moving object as a train that's chugging along. The momentum of that train can be calculated by multiplying its mass (how heavy it is) by its velocity (how fast it's moving). Momentum is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude (size) and direction. We measure it in kilogram meters per second.\n\nNow, let's talk about the law of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum of an isolated system (a bunch of objects that only interact with each other) remains the same. This means that, in a collision or explosion, the total momentum before is equal to the total momentum after. It's like a game of \"pass the momentum\" - when one object loses momentum, another gains it. This law is directly connected to Newton's third law, which tells us that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nTo help you understand this better, let's consider a game of bumper cars. When two cars collide, the force that Car A exerts on Car B is equal to the force that Car B exerts on Car A. And since these forces act for the same amount of time, the momentum lost by Car A is gained by Car B, and vice versa. Pretty cool, huh?\n\nNow, let's tackle a question related to this topic. The question asks about how the law of conservation of momentum relates to Newton's third law. Take a moment to think about it, and if you need extra guidance, you can visit the topic's page mentioned in the show notes.\n\nOh, and did you know that there are other podcasts available for math and science? If you want to expand your knowledge even further, search for \"Revision with Jonas\" on Apple Podcasts or Spotify. Learning can be so much fun!\n\nNext up, we have momentum and force. The change in momentum of a system can be connected to the force acting on it through a simple formula: Force equals change in momentum divided by time. This formula stems from plugging in the acceleration formula into Newton's second law. It's like a formula party!\n\nLet's tackle another question related to this. We have a book of mass 800 grams being pushed off a shelf with a force of 20 Newtons. Given that the book falls with an initial velocity of 2 meters per second, we need to calculate the time of contact between the book and the hand pushing it. Take your time to solve it, and if you're unsure, there's a link in the show notes for extra help.\n\nNow, let's move on to force-time graphs. The change in momentum is also known as impulse. Impulse can be calculated by multiplying the force exerted by the time over which it is exerted. Imagine impulse as the \"extra kick\" given to an object to change its momentum. And guess what? Impulse is represented by the area under a force-time graph for a system.\n\nIf the force-time graph has regular shapes, there might be some mistake in calculating impulse. But don't worry, you can approximate the area under the graph by counting squares if the graph isn't a straight line. It's like playing a puzzle game with forces and times!\n\nTo test your knowledge, here's a question: Define impulse. If you want to double check your answer, there's a link in the show notes for you to refer to.\n\nI hope you've enjoyed this physics adventure, and remember, you've got this!

Have a marvelous week ahead, and until next time!", "podcast_guest": "In Newtonian mechanics, momentum (PL: momenta or momentums; more specifically linear momentum or translational momentum) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If m is an object's mass and v is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum p (from Latin pellere \"push, drive\") is: \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          v\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {p} =m\\mathbf {v} .}\n  \nIn the International System of Units (SI), the unit of measurement of momentum is the kilogram metre per second (kg\u22c5m/s), which is equivalent to the newton-second.\nNewton's second law of motion states that the rate of change of a body's momentum is equal to the net force acting on it. Momentum depends on the frame of reference, but in any inertial frame it is a conserved quantity, meaning that if a closed system is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum does not change. Momentum is also conserved in special relativity (with a modified formula) and, in a modified form,  in electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and general relativity. It is an expression of one of the fundamental symmetries of space and time: translational symmetry.\nAdvanced formulations of classical mechanics, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, allow one to choose coordinate systems that incorporate symmetries and constraints. In these systems the conserved quantity is  generalized momentum, and in general this is different from the kinetic momentum defined above. The concept of generalized momentum is carried over into quantum mechanics, where it becomes an operator on a wave function. The momentum and position operators are related by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\nIn continuous systems such as electromagnetic fields, fluid dynamics and deformable bodies, a momentum density can be defined, and a continuum version of the conservation of momentum leads to equations such as the Navier\u2013Stokes equations for fluids or the Cauchy momentum equation for deformable solids or fluids.", "podcast_highlights": "Hello!
